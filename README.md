# Machine Learning for Terrain Generation and Landscape Metrics

This project was made using [poetry]() --- you will need to install poetry to use this package. To run the code, first clone the repository locally.

## Getting Started

[Ruff formatting linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff), [mypy type checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing, poetry (check CN new starter guide). Git, if you're just getting started recommend GitHub Desktop, or the embedded version in VSCode. What editor? I use VSCode/VSCodium.

1. Install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)

3. Clone this repository
4. In your terminal, navigate to the repository and run `poetry install` this should install all the dependencies required for the project.
5. Open the examples, and check that you can run them.
